I like pets very much, not only cats and dogs, but also others. But some animals cannot be kept as pets, so I buy some dolls instead. I want to create a website to record my "pets", whether they are real animals, or dolls.

I want to use this site to show people the good life together with "pets", and hope that there are friends who like "pets" like me to communicate and share. I also hope that people who do not like pets can treat them well.
